# GIT


- Git is good for complex source code and is used a as "backup" 
- Github does not run code, it's only saving our code, not launching code
  - Github can only run markdowns



# Repository in Git

Repo is "folder git is paying attention to", you are telling git to pay attention to specific folders by doing repositories
Git tracks by line NOT by letter

Want all commits to have unique commmit name
   -this is the reason the commit names are numeric and non-repeating
   
## TWO WAYS TO MAKE REPOS (in command window):


   1) Manually: Will need to create folder and follow directions from curriculum notes
  
   2)Clone Method:
   
   - a. Create a repo in Github Website
   - b. Do git clone REMOTE_URL
        - -->replace REMOTE_URL with the URL from github
        - --> Do this step in the terminal window
        - --> this method will create everything from the folder/directory to all the repo steps in between automatically.
        - --->keep in mind in this method will not need to manually make a directories/folders




# Github Website

Issues: this is similar to a discussion forum

Pull requests: ask for code reviews and add to main source code

To delete repository:

   1) Go to repo you want to delete
  
   2) Setting < Danger Zone < Delete this repository
      - Note: Cannot delete repository from command line window
      - Note: This is a LAST resort try NOT to delete any repositories



# Parallel Universe (Github website)

- Looking at switch/branches/tags list you can see all the different branches listed and they are all active at the same time = Parallel Universe

   - people use older versions still and so older versions are still maintained.
         
         - example: Companies may still use older versions b/c the newer versions need approval for security reasons before they can switch to the newer version.


     # Working in Command line 
     Master is the same as branch main
        
        Daily workflow: git add, git commit, git push
        
          git add: analogy- similar to putting it in the envelope
          git commit: analogy- similar to sealing the envelope
          git push: analogy- similar to sending the envelope




## SQL
          SQL is the most common database manager.

          Queries are questions.


          ## SQL client and Server:
           - Client: What SQL interacts with.
           - Server: Waits for directions from SQL.

           ## SQL Databases:
           -SQL is case insensitive and spaces do not affect SQL.
           -Keep in mind SQL runs from top to bottom; No loops in SQL.
           -If SQL returns null it means you do not have a database selected.
           -Note: ` ` are valid identifiers in SQL.


           ## SQL Tables:
           -SQL has strict data types and unlike spreadsheets, Database tables have a specific set of columns.
           -Databases (DB) are structure this way to help with better data integrity.
           -Use decimal for dollar and cent amounts and not float. This is because float will cause rounding errors.
           -Adding rows in SQL are simple and uncomplicated. While adding columns is more complicated.
           -Null in SQL is sames as none in Python.
           - Foreign key: If table is referencing another table's keys (i.e. Primary key) then that tables has a foreign key because it's referencing another table.


           ## SQL Clauses:
           Order of Elements when there are multiple elements (MUST BE IN THIS ORDER):
           1) SELECT
           2) FROM
           3) WHERE
           4) GROUP BY
           5) HAVING
           6) ORDER BY

#Git
Git is good for complex source code and is used a as "backup" 
Github does not run code, it's only saving our code, not launching code
  -Github can only run markdowns



#Repository in Git
Repo is "folder git is paying attention to", you are telling git to pay attention to specific folders by doing repositories
Git tracks by line NOT by letter
Want all commits to have unique commmit name
   -this is the reason the commit names are numeric and non-repeating
TWO WAYS TO MAKE REPOS(in command window):
   1) Manually: Will neeed to create folder and follow directions in notes
   2)Clone Method:
      Create a repo in Github Website
      Do git clone REMOTE_URL
        -->replace REMOTE_URL with the URL from github
        --> this method will create everything from the folder/directory to all the repo steps in between automatically.
        --->keep in mind in this method will not need to manually make a directories/folders




#Github Website
Issues: this is similar to a discussion forum
Pull requests: ask for code reviews and add to main source code
To delete repository:
   1) Go to repo you want to delete
   2) Setting < Danger Zone < Delete this repository
      Note: Cannot delete repository from command line window



#Parallel Universe (Github website)
Looking at switch/branches/tags list you can see all the different branches listed and they are all active at the same time = Parallel Universe
   - people use older versions still and so older versions are still maintained
     example: Companies may still use older versions b/c the newer versions need approval for security reasons before they can switch to the newer version.


     #Working in Command line 
     Master is the same as branch main
        Daily workflow: git add, git commit, git push
          git add: analogy- putting it in the envelope
          git commit: analogy- sealing the envelope
          git push: sending the envelope
